"The Chinese word for 'Tiananmen Square' in Chinese is 'tonggong (pig))". It means a crowd of people - "a mob gathering around a bullock cart with the bull holding a bull's head."
It was the place where the Chinese military won World War II, and it served as the headquarters for all Chinese troops during WWI except for the Central Government.
When a group of Chinese people gathered at the end of July 1945 to celebrate the victory over Germany, they took part in a public protest against the Communists. The protest lasted about 100 hours before the Communist authorities ordered them to disperse because "they were not fit enough," according to a newspaper story on the occasion. However, they continued their peaceful march through Tiananmen square until midnight when the Chinese Army stormed the site.
In 2005, the United States Embassy in Beijing announced that the Chinese government has been trying to use Tiananman Square since 1989 to promote their foreign policy agenda throughout Asia by using the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). They called it a "political exercise", but "no one could really understand what was going on here or who was doing this." In response, China responded by calling for an international boycott of their products without giving any reason why such a move would be acceptable.
After the endgame between the two sides went down like this, the Chinese Communist Party decided to take control of the site again which caused some major disruption amongst Chinese citizens due to the presence of soldiers from both countries stationed there including the PLA forces. One year later, the PLA had lost much of its manpower and resources while their numbers dwindled significantly resulting in the collapse of the Chinese economy after the military coup. Although the Chinese authorities say that the situation isn't as bad now than it used to be, they have never admitted responsibility.
